# 2025-06-30 Laboratory Session

Noémie, Alan

Noémie had the new QHY 1253P sensor package.

The sensor was not supplied with a power supply. There was an extension that ended in a car adapter. With David’s intervention, someone connected the car adapter to a 12V power supply using crocodile clips.
Noémie installed QHY’s EZCAP software on her Mac.

We opened the sensor. We set the TEC to 50% manually. The power supply read 0.83 A. Stabilized at -3.7 C. The ambient temperature was about 23 C.

We took images with different gains, and that seemed to work. This is our first-light image:

We were able to set the temperature set point.

With TEC at 100%, the power supply read 1.67 A and the detector stabilized at -14.1 C.

We connected to the RPi. The sensor showed up as a “Cypress WestBridge”.

The housing has a ventilator.

We turned off the 12 V supply, but the sensor still appeared on the USB bus on the RPi.
