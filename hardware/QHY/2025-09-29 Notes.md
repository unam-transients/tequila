Alan (CU) and No√©mie (Ensenada) working with the RPi and the QHY sensor.

## USB Capacity

We had the USB flash drive connected to the blue USB3 bus. Whenever we connected the QHY sensor to the blue bus we had problems with the RPi. Specifically, Alan was no longer able to run command, and we were not able to connect by SSH. Alan suspects the current drawn by the QHY was sufficient that the USB memory no longer worked. We apparently fixed this by connecting the USB memory to the white USB2 bus.

We then connected an external USB hard drive to the RPi via the white USB2 bus. It was seen initially, but then was not visible to `fdisk -l`. Alan rebooted the RPi, and it did not come back up. After removing the hard disk, it came back without any problem.

The conclusion seems to be:
- The QHY camera cannot share the USB3 bus with the USB flash memory.
- The USB flash memory cannot share the USB2 bus with USB hard drive.

## Control

I was able to:

- Determine the identifiers of the connected cameras.
- Open the camera by identifier.
- Determine its format.
- Read the temperature and cooler power.
- Read a FITS file.

I was not able to cool it as the external power supply was not connected.

## Documentation

The manual seems to be incomplete. It seems best to read it in conjunction with the header files.
