# 2029-09-30 Notes

Alan (CU) and Noémie (Ensenada)

- Noémie connected the external power supply.
- Initially, Alan was only able to cool to about -2 C, however the airflow was impeded. With the airflow free, he was able to cool it to about -6 C.
- With no cooling but with the fan, the temperature is about 32 C. The previous day, without the fans, it was about 45 C.
- Noémie disconnected the camera and RPi as they were too hot. Her office is at about 30 C.
