# TEQUILA

Tequila is an innovative imaging polarimeter being developed for the second Nasmyth port of COLIBRÍ. The science goals are measuring the evolution of the polarization of the optical afterglow of GRBs and variability in the polarization of blazars.

The project is lead by [Noémie Globus](https://github.com/orgs/unam-transients/people/mahadanah) with technical assistance from [Alan Watson](https://github.com/orgs/unam-transients/people/alanwatsonatwork).
